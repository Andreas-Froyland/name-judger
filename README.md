# Name Judger

This is just a test I made to learn the basics of DaisyUI, TailwindCSS and Vue.

It utilizes these 3 API's to guess nation, age and gender based on a name:

- https://genderize.io
- https://agify.io
- https://nationalize.io

### Built using Vue 3 + Vite


## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

```

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.volar)
